DESCRIPTION

Renewable Energy CLI Project

This application offers a brief overview of renewable energies and an introduction to the organization IRENA.

We are overly dependent on fossil fuels. Some environments, especially islands in particular, are not well suited for fossil fuels and tethered power grids.

The goal of this app is to help raise awareness of different renewable energy sources and inspire the user to seek out clean energy initiatives.
